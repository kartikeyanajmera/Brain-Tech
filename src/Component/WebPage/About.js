              <p className="text-blue-gray-700 text-center">
                Indiaâ€™s mental health is in a state of crisis. While 1 billion
                people around the world live with a mental health condition,
                India alone accounts for a third of the global burden of
                depression, addictions, and suicides. India has the youngest
                population in the world - and yet, over 100 million children
                and youth have diagnosed mental health conditions. Due to a
                combination of poor awareness, stigma, and lack of access to
                quality care, a person who is struggling with their mental
                health often does not receive the treatment and care they need
                to get better.
